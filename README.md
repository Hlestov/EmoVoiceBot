# EmoVoiceBot 

This is a Telegram bot that utilizes deep learning models to recognize and analyze the emotional tone of voice messages. The bot is built using Python and the Telegram Bot API, and can be easily integrated into any Telegram chat.

When a user sends a voice message to the bot, it processes the message using a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model and returns a textual analysis of the emotional color of the message. The user can then get an understanding of the tone of their message and use that information to improve communication with their chat partners.

The Wav2Vec2 model used in this project was trained on Russian language speech data, and can recognize several emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.
